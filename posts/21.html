    A Rythm game made from scratch in C++ using SDL2. It is heavily inspired by the franchise "Taiko no Tatsujin" and by the game "osu!"<br>
    The game is still in development, but the core gameplay is done. The game is playable, there are menus, animations, and a scoring system.<br>
    What needs to be done is the implementation of a level editor, that will allow the player to create their own levels, and some more animations.<br>
    I havent yet implemented graphics, so everything is done using SDL2's primitives.<br>
    <br>
    The game is still in development.
