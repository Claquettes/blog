    <p>A script made with Selenium in Python to help the player wins at the game Pedantix using brute force. The script imput a selection of words to fill the blanks and give the player a huge boost at the beginning of the game. Antonin Sylvestre helped me by writting a script to pick the best words from a 600 000 words dictionnary.
      The GUI was made using Tkinter, and it allows the user to choose the number of words he wants to input and start the script.
