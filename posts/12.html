    <p>It's a calm and relaxing game where you can make your own tiny island/garden. You have the ability to export/import every creation you make, and share it with your friends. The project was started by myself, but other members (FlashOnFire, Sun and Tibouyou) of the AuttGames Team joined me later. Together we added more than 100 differents tiles, the ability to change the size of the island, a day night cycle, and way more! It was made using Js canvas.
      The exemple island you see above was made by Sun. The site also has a lofi playlist embeded, using a soundcloud iframe.
