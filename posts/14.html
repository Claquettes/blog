        Miso Mania is a 2D platform game. This game is at the crossroads, between platform game and die and retry. The player controls a character who must reach the end of the level. The game feature a level editor, a level sharing system as well as a leaderboard. 
        </br>
        Miso Mania allows the player to create an user inside of the game, and this user can purchase skins for the character, and can also purchase particles. The coins are earned by completing levels, and the closer the player is to the top of the leaderboard, the more coins he will earn.
        </br>
        The game is distributed on WSL, Mac and Linux. The game was created using SDL2 library and C++ by Romain Rochebloine, Jules Ginhac and myself.
