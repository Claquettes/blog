    <p>A minimalist Snake game playable in the browser, created in Html, CSS and Javascript. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without touching the walls or the snake's body. The game was developed in 3 days, it was a personal challenge to see if I could create a game in such a short time. The player has the option to choose the speed of the snake as well as a "safety distance" (which prevents apples from appearing too close to the edges).
