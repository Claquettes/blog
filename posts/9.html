    <p>A python script to generate "ratios". It will generate a sentence starting with "ratio +" and then a random word from a list of words. The goal is to make a funny sentence. The library of words is composed of popular internet references, memes, french expressions and inside jokes from Polytech Lyon's students.
      Uku3lig helped me to tweak the script to make it work better. The GUI was made using Tkinter.
