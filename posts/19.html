    This blog serves as a platform where I share my projects, thoughts, learning process, and experiences as a developer. It aims to document my journey and provide a space for me to easily share my work with others, beyond GitHub or a traditional resume.
    <br>
    My personal dev blog is a place where I showcase my projects, reflect on my progress, and share insights into my development journey. Through this blog, I aim to engage with a wider community, gather feedback, and continue learning from others.
    <br>
    The blog is built using simple HTML and CSS for the design, while JavaScript handles the logic. The posts are stored as HTML files, and the site is dynamically generated using the data from these files. This setup allows for easy maintenance and scalability.

    It was really fun to build this blog, and I am excited to continue adding new features and posts to it.
