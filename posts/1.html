    <p>Well, this is where we start. One afternoon I was bored so I tried looking for tutorials on how to make simple web games. I found a tutorial to make an infinite runner in Js and that's how i started learning it. Weeks later, as the project became more ambitous, i was joined by other students from Polytech Lyon and we started the AuttGames Team.
        The Dinau'tt is obviously inspired by the dino game by google. I learnt the basics of canvas, and arrays. I also learnt setInterval and setTimeOut functions. We later implemented a leaderboard to keep track of the better scores, using php and a database.</p>
