    <p>Another Python script with a gui made with Tkinter. This script is a Wikipedia scraper that allows the user to search for a word and then the script will return the text from the Wikipedia page. The script also allows the user to copy and paste in one click the text from the Wikipedia page. The user can choose between 8 languages. It was designed to troll my friends on Discord.
