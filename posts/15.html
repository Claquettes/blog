    <p> Project carried out as part of my studies at Polytech Lyon, with <a href="https://www.maxime-antoine.fr/">Maxime Antoine</a>, Jules Ginhac and Pablo Verchère under the supervision of M. Bonnevay Stéphane. 
    </br>
    The goal of the project was to develop a python program to find the shortest path between 100 points on a map. This project was a version of The Salesman problem (TSP). The program allowed the user to choose between 1 truck to deliver all of the points, or multiple trucks. 
    </br>
    The program was developed using the python library Turtle, and the algorithm used was the nearest neighbor algorithm for the initial solution, and 2-opt, relocate and swap for the local search. All of the algorithms were developed by us.
    </br>
    The program had a GUI, that showed in real time the current best path. All of the data was saved in .xlsx files to allow us to analyze the results.
    </br>
    We were ranked 1st out of 40 groups, with a grade of 19/20.
