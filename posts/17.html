    This project was my first VsCode extension. This extension was made using boiler plate from Yeoman and from VsCode templates. I used webviews to create a window where appear a random cat image and a motivational quote. When the user start VsCode, he is greeted by this window in the explorer tab. I plan to put it on the marketplace once I have a few more features.
