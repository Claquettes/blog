    CatWisdom holds a special place in my heart as it marks my first venture into creating a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension. Leveraging boilerplate code from Yeoman and VSCode templates. 
    <br>
    To develop CatWisdom, I utilized webviews, a powerful component of VSCode extensions. With webviews, I created a dedicated window within the explorer tab that presents users with a delightful experience upon launching VSCode. This window features a random cat image and an accompanying quote about programming, injecting a touch of humor and inspiration into the coding environment.
    <br>
    CatWisdom has set the foundation for my future extension projects, and I am eager to continue expanding my skills and creating tools that enhance the coding experience.
