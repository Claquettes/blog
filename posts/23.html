    A SandBox game made with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project was inspired by the game "The Powder Toy". <br>
    Currently, the user can place solids, liquids, powders and gases. The goal is also to add a lot of different elements, and to add a lot of interactions between them. <br>
    The game is still in development.
