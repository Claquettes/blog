    A SandBox game made with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project was inspired by the game "The Powder Toy". <br>
    Currently, the user can place solids, liquids, powders, explosives and gases. The goal is also to add a lot of different elements, and to add a lot of interactions between them. <br>
    The latest verion introduces electricity, and the ability to create circuits by placing wires and logic gates. <br>
    The game is still in development, and I'm working on it from time to time. <br>
