    A website I made for LeTacoToqué, a french streaming group and e-sport Team which I co-founded. They are really great people, and they needed a website to easily share all of their social media and content. <br>
    To make the site, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used the template i made the index page of this site, and modified it to fit their needs. This time, I made a simple css animation for the background, and a Js script that randomly create a grid of emojis that fits the screen size. <br>
