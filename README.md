# DEV BLOG  
--------------------------
## Description   

This is my personal blog where I will be posting my projects and my thoughts about them. I will also be posting about my learning process and my experience as a developer. The goal behind this project is to document my journey as a developer, and to have a place where I can share my work with others, more easily than on github or on a resume.
--------------------------
## Technologies used   

The site is built using simple HTML and CSS, and all of the logic is handled by Javascript. All of posts are stored in html files, and the site is built dynamically using the data from those files. 
--------------------------
## Thoughts

It was nice to look back at my old projects and see how much I have improved since then. I also enjoyed the process of building the site. I think that this project was a great way to document my journey as a developer, and I will continue to use it to document my progress.
