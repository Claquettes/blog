Welcome to my personal development blog! This blog serves as a platform where I share my projects, thoughts, learning process, and experiences as a developer. It aims to document my journey and provide a space for me to easily share my work with others, beyond GitHub or a traditional resume.

## Description

My personal dev blog is a place where I showcase my projects, reflect on my progress, and share insights into my development journey. Through this blog, I aim to engage with a wider community, gather feedback, and continue learning from others.

## Technologies Used

The blog is built using simple HTML and CSS for the design, while JavaScript handles the logic. The posts are stored as HTML files, and the site is dynamically generated using the data from these files. This setup allows for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Usage

To access and explore my dev blog, simply visit [ponton-mathi.eu/blog](https://ponton-mathi.eu/blog). There, you will find a collection of posts, each discussing a project, my thoughts, or my experiences as a developer. 

## Contributing

## Thoughts

Building this blog has been a fulfilling experience. It provided an opportunity to reflect on my past projects, witnessing how much I have improved since then. The process of developing the site, from design to implementation, was enjoyable and educational. I believe this project has become an invaluable documentation of my growth as a developer, and I look forward to using it as a tool to track my progress in the future.
