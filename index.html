            <p>Well, this is where we start. One afternoon I was bored so I tried looking for tutorials on how to make simple web games. I found a tutorial to make an infinite runner in Js and that's how i started learning it. Weeks later, as the project became more ambitous, i was joined by other students from Polytech Lyon and we started the AuttGames Team.
                The Dinau'tt is obviously inspired by the dino game by google. I learnt the basics of canvas, and arrays. I also learnt setInterval and setTimeOut functions. We later implemented a leaderboard to keep track of the better scores, using php and a database.</p>

            <p>A minimalist Snake game playable in the browser, created in Html, CSS and Javascript. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without touching the walls or the snake's body. The game was developed in 3 days, it was a personal challenge to see if I could create a game in such a short time. The player has the option to choose the speed of the snake as well as a "safety distance" (which prevents apples from appearing too close to the edges).

            <p>It's a calm and relaxing game where you can make your own tiny island/garden. You have the ability to export/import every creation you make, and share it with your friends. The project was started by myself, but other members (FlashOnFire, Sun and Tibouyou) of the AuttGames Team joined me later. Together we added more than 100 differents tiles, the ability to change the size of the island, a day night cycle, and way more! It was made using Js canvas.
              The exemple island you see above was made by Sun. The site also has a lofi playlist embeded, using a soundcloud iframe.
