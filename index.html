            <p>Well, this is where we start. One afternoon I was bored so I tried looking for tutorials on how to make simple web games. I found a tutorial to make an infinite runner in Js and that's how i started learning it. Weeks later, as the project became more ambitous, i was joined by other students from Polytech Lyon and we started the AuttGames Team.
                The Dinau'tt is obviously inspired by the dino game by google. I learnt the basics of canvas, and arrays. I also learnt setInterval and setTimeOut functions. We later implemented a leaderboard to keep track of the better scores, using php and a database.</p>

            <p>A minimalist Snake game playable in the browser, created in Html, CSS and Javascript. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without touching the walls or the snake's body. The game was developed in 3 days, it was a personal challenge to see if I could create a game in such a short time. The player has the option to choose the speed of the snake as well as a "safety distance" (which prevents apples from appearing too close to the edges).
